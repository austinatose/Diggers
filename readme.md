# Diggers

Oh no! Itâ€™s the year 3000 AD and Earth has reached an unsurvivable temperature due to global warming! You are on the surface of the earth with a few other humans, and you know that there is a bunker underneath the ground that uses the lost technology of air conditioning, which will allow you to survive the hellish conditions outside. However, the bunker can only hold one person, and the creator of the bunker was trying to be funny so he put two decoy doors beside the actual entrance to the bunker. You must compete with others by being the best DIGGER, and dig into the ground to ESCAPE into the ROOM for air conditioning.
