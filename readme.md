# Diggers

You were playing Minecraft during CEP lesson on your laptop but then for some unkown reason, you got sucked into the game. Hidden beneath 15 layers of rock is the treasure you have always wanted. But others playing on your server also got sucked in, so you need to get the treasure first. Who will win?
